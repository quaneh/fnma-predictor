# FNMA Mortgage Default Predictor

The purpose of this project is to practice training a model and deploying it in a production environment.

The fnma_predictor.ipynb notebook contains a rundown of how to train and save the model.

After training the model, the model is Dockerised.

We build a Docker image and run the image to test it locally.
